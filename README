********************************
3D-Modeling Application
	developed by deCampos A.
********************************

This application is designed for making 3D models out of simple Three Dimensional Draftings, which can be loaded from existing data or captured with the camera.

1. Components

Consists of the main file "3d_modeling.c", auxiliary image file "00.pbm", and Makefile. Compilation can also be made directly with " gcc -fopenmp -o 3d_modeling 3d_modeling.c  -lglut -lGLU -lGL `pkg-config opencv --cflags` `pkg-config opencv --libs` "
Program Execution save files to "00f.pbm", "00r.pbm", "00u.pbm", and potentially also to "0pic1.ppm", "0pic2.ppm", "0pic3.ppm", "0data1.pbm", "0data2.pbm" and "0data3.pbm".

2.How to use

2.1. Modes

2.1.1. Loading mode

Loads up to three Images to create the 3-dimensional model.

When initializing the application, INPUT the FILE NAME for FRONT view, RIGHT view and UP view images, in this order.
Use SQUARE-SIZED IMAGES for maintaining proportions.

When LESS THAN THREE Images are designed, the program will AUTOMATICALLY LOAD "00.pbm", an entirely black bitmat image, for the pendant arguments.


2.1.2. Capture mode

Create a 3-dimensional model out of pictures taken by the camera device, that will be then used as the FRONT, RIGHT and UP images, in this order.

For this mode, initialize the application WITHOUT ANY variables.

During the capture, PRESS ENTER for SAVING the current image, SPACE for SKIPPING a shot, or ESCAPE for EXITING. 
"00.pbm" will be AUTOMATICALLY LOAD for filling up skipped shots.


2.1.3. Edit mode

Loads up to three Images for THRESHOLDING, and then use this Images in the creation of the 3-dimensional model.

For this mode, TYPE "edit" and then up to three FILE NAMES when initializing the application.

During the editing, PRESS ENTER for SAVING or ESCAPE for EXITING.


2.2 Rendering Quality

For better Rendering quality, INCREASE the value of "SIZE", defined in the 11th line of the program. Each vortex has arrest size of 4/SIZE. When using values below 100, UPDATE HEADER's value to 13 (11th line).

Excessively high SIZE values will cause heavy excecution and/or compile error.


2.3 Tips

For better results, ALIGN every input Image, and ,for shapes well defined with only 2 parameters, use AUTOLOADING of "00.pbm".

When unnable to get satisfactory results from THRESHOLDING, try editing the images directly with other IMAGE EDITING APPLICATIONS. 
CAPTURED Images can be found in "0pic1.ppm", "0pic2.ppm" and "0pic3.ppm"; and THRESHOLDED Images in "0data1.pbm", "0data2.pbm" and "0data3.pbm".
